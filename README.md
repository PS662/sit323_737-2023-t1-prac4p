## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Send a POST request with JSON payload to one of the following endpoints:

    /add for addition
    /subtract for subtraction
    /multiply for multiplication
    /divide for division

The JSON payload should contain two parameters, num1 and num2, representing the two numbers to perform the arithmetic operation on. The response will be a JSON object containing the result of the operation.

For example, to perform an addition operation on the numbers 2 and 3, send the following POST request:

```
POST /add HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "num1": 2,
  "num2": 3
}
```
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "result": 5
}
```
